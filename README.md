# Continuous-Brawl

(Coded for testing purposes, using the developer API, Bukkit)

This is a continuous Arena-PvP plugin featuring a gamemode where one selects a kit, and jumps straight into action, and respawns upon death.
There are multiple kits to choose from, and once a kit is selected, its respective items will be given to you to battle with. Utilize the 
different kits and the arena around you to aim for a greater killstreak than opponents.
